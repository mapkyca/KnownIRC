IRC Support for Known
=====================

This plugin provides the ability to syndicate short messages, and share posts and images to IRC channels

Installation
------------

* Drop the IRC folder into the IdnoPlugins folder of your Known installation.
* Log into Known and navigate to Site configuration > Plugins.
* Enable the IRC plugin on the Plugins page.


Usage:
------

Once activated, go to your user settings -> IRC page, where you'll have the ability to add 
channels on various servers/networks. 

Configure your channel and you'll be able to post short messages straight into the channel.

Limitations:
------------

* Only one username per network, so if you sit on IRC, use a different nickname.
* Apache PHP mod generally has threads disabled, therefor this plugin doesn't have a daemon/bot. This means that it'll join -> post -> leave your channel. Try to avoid spamming :)
